GEMS is a generative Euclidean melodic sequencer plugin for the VCV Rack virtual modular synthesis system.
It is presented free, as is, but a coffee is always appreciated to help spur further development.

Further plans include VST/AU versions for Mac and PC, Auv3 version for IoS and a prototype hardware unit is in the process of being built.
Please also see 'license.txt'.
I would love to hear from you with suggestions for future features or how to implement current features better.
HOW TO INSTALL: In your VCV Rack Plugins folder make a new subfolder called GEMS and copy and paste 'plugin.dylib', 'plugin.json' and the folder 'res' together with it's contents, GEMS.svg. Restart VCV Rack and the plugin should now be accessible via the modules popup with a right-click in a black space. Search for "G.E.M.S" in the search box at top left.
Feed it a clock and a reset signal eg from CLKD and the outputs CV and GATE go to a synth voice as usual.
Hover the mouse over the module and you can change the scale from which notes will be selected by using the computer keyboard (s,d,g,h,j for the black keys and Z to m for the white keys). If multiple instances of GEMS are running you can change them all at once using the SHIFT key.
Click on a knob to see it's current value. After an adjustment has been made, a popup window will show the new value.
